IMDB Clone
This is a mini IMDB clone app implemented using vanilla JavaScript. The app interacts with the OMDB API (https://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch movie information and display it on the frontend.

Features:

Search Movies: Users can search for movies in the search box, and the app will provide auto-suggestions as they type.

Auto-suggestions: The app suggests movie titles based on the user's input, just like Google's suggestions.

View Movie Details: Users can click on a movie from the search results to view more information about that movie.

Add to Favourites: Each movie in the search results has an "Add to Favourites" button, which allows users to add the movie to their list of favourite movies.
Movie Page

Detailed Information: When a user clicks on a movie from the search results, the app opens a new page with detailed information about that movie, including its name, photo, plot, year, rating, writer, actors, language, and more.
My Favourite Movies Page

 Favourites: The app stores the list of favourite movies in the browser's localStorage, ensuring that the list remains intact even after the user closes or refreshes the browser.

Remove from Favourites: Each movie in the "My Favourite Movies" list has a "Remove from Favourites" button, allowing users to remove movies from their favourites list.
